# GOAP TFG
This is my final degre project, is a visual tool that implements a GOAL, even is functional is still an early stage and I don't believe that this tool can be used for development yet,but feel free to use it and modify wherever you want.

Inside this readme you can find a tutorial video and inside this package a demo that shows how the tool works.

Also the virtual function that you need to override to create your own actions and goals have a little commentary that will help you to understand what you need to do.

The actions and goals of the demo are stored in GOAPFramework\Scripts\GOAP\GoapFunctions
